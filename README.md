# Bautista Moodle

This project aims to develop a comprehensive virtual platform for the Bautista High School in LeÃ³n, Nicaragua, with the goal of streamlining academic management. This platform will focus on automating and centralizing processes such as enrollment, scheduling, student assessment, and communication between teachers, students, and parents. We are using [CMS Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Main_page) to develop this software.
